# Hi! I'm Lucas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3rd-year CS student at the University of Windsor. I've completed 2 software development co-ops at RBC, where I developed various full-stack internal tools. I enjoy coding, especially competitive programming, rock climbing, walking my dog, reading sci-fi, and gaming. Let me know if you want to connect!
