I'm a 3rd-year CS student at the University of Windsor passionate about full-stack development and machine learning. I've completed 2 software development internships at RBC, where I developed various full-stack internal tools. I enjoy coding, especially competitive programming, rock climbing, walking my dog, reading sci-fi, and gaming. Let me know if you want to connect!
